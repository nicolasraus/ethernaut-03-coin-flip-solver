# Ethernaut Level 03 Coin Flip Solver

To run this code you will need to have a ".env" file filled with SEPOLIA_RPC_URL, PRIVATE_KEY and TARGET_CONTRACT_ADDRESS filled. Where:
- SEPOLIA_RPC_URL = https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/[YOUR-API-KEY]
- PRIVATE_KEY = [YOUR-WALLET-ACCOUNT-PRIVATE-KEY]
- TARGET_CONTRACT_ADDRESS = [contract.address()]

You can run it locally and play around by executing `yarn hardhat deploy`. To run it in the testnet network just execute `yarn hardhat deploy --network sepolia`
